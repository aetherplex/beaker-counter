# Beaker Counter

A (very) simple counter application using Algorand's Beaker framework, Next.js, ChakraUI, and Jotai.

Assumes you have the Algorand Sandbox running locally.

To start the dev server, clone this repo and run:

```
pnpm install && pnpm run dev
```

Currently only uses the Sandbox accounts directly (no brower wallets).
